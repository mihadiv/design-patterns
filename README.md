## 📁 Project Structure

```
src/
└── pattern-name/
    ├── Main.java
    └── ClassExample.java
```

Each folder corresponds to one design pattern, with a minimal working Java example.

## 🚀 How to Run

You can run each example using any Java IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA), or from the terminal:

```bash
javac src/pattern-name/*.java
java src/pattern-name/Main
```

## 🎯 Goal

The goal of this project is to:
- Understand key design patterns
- Practice clean, testable, maintainable code
- Support learning through hands-on implementation
